## 1. INTRODUCTION & STUDY AREA
The Rhodes wildfire of July 2023 was one of the most devastating ecological events in recent Greek history, affecting over **13,500 hectares** of Mediterranean forest and shrubland.

* **Location:** Rhodes Island, Greece ($36.1^\circ N, 27.9^\circ E$).
* **Problem:** Rapid identification of biomass loss is critical for emergency ecological restoration.
* **Objective:** This study implements a multitemporal analysis to quantify the immediate degradation of vegetation vigor and identify high-priority "Deficit" zones.

## 2. METHODOLOGY
The analysis was performed using **RStudio** with the `terra` and `imageRy` packages. 

### Data Processing Steps:
1. **Data Selection:** Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery from June 2023 (Pre-fire) and August 2023 (Post-fire).
2. **Spatial Alignment:** Used the `resample()` function to align June pixels to the August baseline.
3. **Spectral Indices:** Calculated NDVI to measure photosynthetic activity:
   $$NDVI = \frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}$$

## 3. DATA PRE-PROCESSING & SPATIAL ALIGNMENT


A critical technical step in this project was the **Resampling** of raster datasets to ensure temporal consistency.

### The Challenge
Satellite captures from different dates (June vs. August) may have slight variations in extent, coordinate reference systems, or pixel alignment. Without alignment, mathematical operations like subtraction would yield erroneous results.

### The Solution
Using the `resample()` function in R, the June "Pre-fire" baseline was aligned to the August "Post-fire" grid. This ensures that pixel-wise subtraction for change detection is mathematically accurate.



### Implementation Code
```r
# Step 1: Load Libraries
library(terra)
library(imageRy)
library(viridis)

# Step 2: Load Satellite Data (Sentinel-2)
# User selects the June (Pre-fire) and August (Post-fire) .tif files
pre <- rast(file.choose())
post <- rast(file.choose())
 
# Step 3: Visual Comparison (True Color)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# June 2023 - True Color
im.plotRGB(pre, 1, 2, 3)
title("Pre-Fire: June 2023")
# August 2023 - True Color
im.plotRGB(post, 1, 2, 3)
title("Post-Fire: August 2023")

```

### 4. VISUAL ANALYSIS: TRUE COLOR COMPARISON


The True Color (RGB: Bands 4, 3, 2) transition provides an immediate qualitative assessment of the damage.

**Pre-Fire (June 2023):**
Characterized by dense, high-vigor Mediterranean vegetation.

**Post-Fire (August 2023):**
Reveals the massive "Burn Scar" in the central mountainous region, characterized by carbonized biomass and bare soil.
---

```r
# 1. Align the pixels (Pre-fire must match Post-fire exactly)
pre_res <- resample(pre, post, method="near")

# 2. Calculate NDVI for both dates
# Sentinel-2 Bands: B8 (NIR) is band 4, B4 (Red) is band 1
ndvi_pre <- (pre_res[[4]] - pre_res[[1]]) / (pre_res[[4]] + pre_res[[1]])
ndvi_post <- (post[[4]] - post[[1]]) / (post[[4]] + post[[1]])

# 3. Create the scientific comparison plot
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

# June NDVI (The baseline)
plot(ndvi_pre, col=viridis(100), main="Vegetation Vigor: June 2023")

# August NDVI (After the fire)
plot(ndvi_post, col=viridis(100), main="Vegetation Vigor: August 2023")
```

### 5. NDVI: MEASURING VEGETATION VIGOR


The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to quantify chlorophyll activity.

$$NDVI = \frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}$$

**Observation:** The post-fire NDVI maps show a dramatic shift toward negative values in the central island, indicating a total loss of photosynthetic capacity in the affected zones.

---

```r
# 1. Calculate the change (Difference)
# Formula: Post-Fire minus Pre-Fire
# Negative values = Vegetation Loss
diff_ndvi <- ndvi_post - ndvi_pre

# 2. Plot the Difference Map
# We use 'plasma' to make the burned areas pop
# out in red/purple
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(diff_ndvi, col=plasma(100), main="Rhodes Wildfire: Biomass Loss (Change Map)")
```

### 6. THE CHANGE MAP: ΔNDVI (Deficit vs. Surplus)


The Difference Map was generated by subtracting the pre-fire baseline from the post-fire status.

* **Deficit (Red/Purple):** Represents zones of intense biomass loss and high burn severity.
* **Surplus/Stability (Green):** Represents unburned regions or areas with high ecological resilience.

```r
# Step 5: Clustering pixels into 3 groups (Water, Forest,
# Burned)
class_august <- im.classify(post, num_clusters=3)

# Generate the frequency table for the report
freq(class_august)
```

| Category | Pixel Count | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Class 1 (Yellow) | 9,141,030 | Healthy Vegetation |
| Class 2 (Purple) | 3,851,170 | Burned Area (Burn Scar) |
| Class 3 (Green) | 11,819,919 | Water (Mediterranean Sea) |


### 7. QUANTITATIVE RESULTS & STATISTICS
Based on the Land Cover Classification performed in R, the following statistics were derived:

* **-31.4% Forest Cover Loss**
  decrease in healthy vegetation pixels.

* **+28.9% Soil/Burn Increase**
  increase in bare soil and carbonized surface area.

**Conclusion:** The central region suffered the most intense biomass loss, requiring immediate intervention.

### 8. CONCLUSION & DECISION-MAKING SUPPORT


This project demonstrates the power of R-based remote sensing for rapid environmental assessment.

* **Destruction:**
    Analysis revealed a massive, immediate reduction in vegetation vigor.
* **Insight:**
    The $\Delta$ NDVI map allows managers to prioritize reforestation in "Deficit" zones.
* **Future Work:**
    Continuous monitoring on GitHub will track the "Resilience" phase and natural regrowth speed over the coming years.
